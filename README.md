# The Simple Console Emulator for Windows
*kindof*

Not quite an 'emulator' but it's pretty darn coolish.

Great for using the cmd utility when the network admin has restricted access to it. The editor also comes with a *basic* config file system where you can run apps with a set alias configured within, it's best used for simplifying windows commands (eg dir to ls or cls to clear).

# To Install
For nightly builds: master/bin

For stable builds: release/bin

Copy the folder into a flash drive, or the contents into your Windows directory, and run it from there!

## Tested in:
Unrestricted: Windows 10, 7 (both passing)

Restricted: Windows 7 (passing)
